## About
I used to have a much lengthier explanation of who I am, my experiences in technology, etc., but I've grown tired of maintaining it all.  I used to be a software engineer, but I found myself in a position to start an architecture team at Quicken Loans so I became a leader.

I'm hoping to use this as a platform to start blogging about my experiences going from engineer to leader.  Only time will tell how successful I am with that, but it's a goal!

Some quick facts about me:
* I am a photographer: <a href="http://exifocus.com" target="_blank">Exifocus.com</a>
* I am a huge fan of <a href="http://fsharp.org" target="_blank">F#</a>
* I love <a href="http://www.ted.com" target="_blank">Ted Talks</a>
* I have worked for 3x mortgage companies in my career
* I am a <em>rabid</em> fan of <a href="http://www.detcityfc.com/" target="_blank">Detroit City Football Club</a> (I cannot put too fine a point on that)
