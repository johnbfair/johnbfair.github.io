## Contact

I love meeting new people, but since most people are contact me are recruiters I must insist you refrain.

If you want to talk technology, leadership, leveling up, F#, architecture, photography, bourbon, or just generally chat I'm more than happy!
But if you're looking to recruit me for the latest tech mashupurtnity, role I'm completely unqualified for, role I haven't done in 10 years,
or role in general...please feel free to move onto your next Google resume search.
